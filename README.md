https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation

### Competition Description
Neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and brain tumors,
are major global health issues causing death and disability.
Evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for these disorders is challenging.
One common method involves examining neuronal cells through light microscopy,
but segmenting these cells accurately is difficult and time-consuming.
Improved instance segmentation through computer vision could facilitate drug discovery.
